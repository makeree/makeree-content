### Time to make

1 Hour 25 Minutes.

### Materials

- 6 Feet (2 Meters) of Thin Electric wire - Solid (preferably AWG30).
- 1 AA battery.
- 1 Large bolt or screwdriver (diameter of at least 0.5mm).
- Cutter.
- Cello tape / masking tape / duct tape

## Lesson steps

### Step 1

#### Description

Take the 6 feet (2 meters) of electric wire.

### Step 2

#### Description

Using the cutter, pinch the wire’s isolation 0.5” (1 cm) from the wire's end. Be careful not to touch the wire itself, only the plastic cover.

### Step 3

#### Description

With a pulling motion peel 0.5” (1 cm) of the cover off the wire until it is fully exposed.

#### Important

With a pulling motion peel 0.5” (1 cm) of the cover off the wire until it is fully exposed.

### Step 4

#### Description

Repeat process on the other end of the wire.

#### Important

See that the wire is solid. Solid wire has only one lead and is rigid, compared to stranded wire which has multiple leads and is more flexible. Solid wires work better for high voltage applications, while stranded wires work better for low voltage applications.

### Step 5

#### Description

Start wrapping the wire around the bolt starting 1” (3 cm) down the wire.

### Step 6

#### Description

Starting from the bolt’s head, wrap the wire around the bolt firmly, creating windings as close as possible to one another. Try not to overlap, though.

#### Important

If gaps are created between wire windings, you can always press down the wire, diminishing them with your fingers.

### Step 7

#### Description

When you reach the end of the bolt, start wrapping the wire the other way. Now there is no problem with overlapping.

### Step 8

#### Description

Continue wrapping the wire. Leave 1” (3 cm) of unwrapped wire on the other end as well.

### Step 9

#### Description

Using a piece of tape, secure the coil you created onto the bolt.

### Step 10

#### Description

Using another piece of tape, attach the AA battery to the bolt.

### Step 11

#### Description

Connect the nearest end of the wire to the battery's negative terminal.

### Step 12

#### Description

Secure it with a small piece of tape.

### Step 13

#### Description

Congratulations! You have just built an electromagnet – your first creation.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson1-Electromagnet/assets/step13.jpg)

#### Important

An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is induced by electric current. In a regular magnet the material itself produces a magnetic field and not an electric current.

### Step 14

#### Description

Hold the bolt in the air and bring the loose wire end to the battery’s positive terminal.

### Step 15

#### Description

Use the end of the bolt to pick metallic paper clips. Can you chain paper clips to one another, transferring magnetic field through a chain of paper clips?

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson1-Electromagnet/assets/step15.jpg)

#### Important

What has just happened here? When both ends of the wire are connected to the battery, electric current starts flowing through the wire. The electric current generates a small magnetic field around it. The coil you created around the bolt allowed all the small fields to accumulate into a larger magnetic field and temporarily magnetize the bolt, allowing it to attract small metallic paper clips.
