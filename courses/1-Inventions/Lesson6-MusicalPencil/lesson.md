> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson5-MusicalPencil/assets/step1.jpg)

#### Important

A breadboard is hive-like component used to quickly build and test electrical circuits. Every column of the mini-breadboard (a set of 5 compartments) is connected underneath by a metal surface. Circuit components (LEDs, wires, capacitors, resistors, etc..) that are inserted into compartments on the same column are instantly connected to each other. A separation slit devides the breadboard horizontally, separating it into to areas: UP - further from the user and DOWN - closer to the user.


### Step 2

#### Description 

Labeling the columns with numbers will help differentiate the columns for further handling. We will mostly be using columns 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 and 15.
