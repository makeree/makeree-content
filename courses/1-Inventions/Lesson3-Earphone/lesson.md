### Step 4

#### Description

Place the first strip of tape, sticky side up, on your working surface

### Step 5

#### Description

Add another strip of tape, slightly overlapping the first one

### Step 6

#### Description

Repeat, creating a rectangular adhesive surface of about 5'' by 5'' (13 cm x 13 cm)

### Step 7 

#### Description

Place the magnet wire on your working surface.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/step7.jpg) 

#### Important

Magnet wire is a copper or aluminium wire coated with a thin layer of isolation. It conducts electricity, usually inducing a magnetic field.



### Step 8

#### Description

Bend the wire at a point about 6'' (15 cm) from the start. Place the bending point at the center of the sticky surface so the trailing wire sticks out.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/step8.jpg)

### Step 9

#### Description

Coil the long part of the wire around the initial bending point. Press the wire onto the adhesive surface to insure fixation.

### Step 10

#### Description

Spiral outwards around and around.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/step10.jpg)




### Step 11

#### Description

Continue coiling the wire, leaving small gaps between laps.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/step11.jpg)

#### Important

Don't worry if coiling results in overlapping. The wires are protected by an isolating coating, so no electrical harm can be done. Overlapping too frequently might result in the wire detaching from the adhesive surface.


### Step 12

#### Description

Leaving a 5'' (13cm) segment at the end, stop coiling and bend the wire outwards.

### Step 13

#### Description

Cover the coil you've made with 3 strips of masking tape.

### Step 14

#### Description

### Step 16

#### Description

Cut a 3'' (8 cm) strip of masking tape.

### Step 19

#### Description

Connect the end of the magnet strip, to the top of the coiled membrane with a small piece of tape

### Step 20

#### Description

Fold the magnet strip over to the other side

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/step20.jpg)

### Step 21

#### Description

Place the magnet at the center of the coil.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/step21.jpg)

### Step 22

#### Description

Use a lighter and burn both ends of the wire, sticking out of the masking tape.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/step22.jpg)

#### Important

Burning the edge of the wire removes the plastic isolating coating. The magnetic wire is extremely thin, so stripping the insulation with the use of cutters will most likely break it.


### Step 23

#### Description

Once cool, expose the conductive wire by wiping the melted isolation away.

### Step 24

#### Description

Cut the PL cable in half.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/step24.jpg)

#### Important

This motor generates motion with the use of electrically charged particles in a magnetic field. Current flows through the wire, meaning electrons are moving in a certain direction along the wire. Since the wire is placed in a magnetic field, the electrons are affected by a force vigorously moving them in a different direction and therefore creating the accelerating movement of the coil. This basic law of physics is called the Lorentz force. Although the motion generating principles at the base of the Homopolar Motor are simple, it is are rarely used nowadays as it is an inefficient motor- requiring large current flow and producing relatively small forces.



### Step 25

#### Description

Use the cutters to expose about 0.5'' (1 cm) of the PL cable. If your cable's inner wiring is not similar to the picture, follow the tip to continue.

#### Important

If your PL cable has fabric coated wires, begin exposing by gently peeling away the inner silver lining

#### Important

Expose 3 inner wires inside the cable.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/Extra/step25/extra2.jpg)  

#### Important

Use a lighter to burn a short section of each of the internal wires.

#### Important

Once cool, wipe the melted isolation away.
> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/Extra/step25/extra4.jpg)  

#### Important

After exposing the inner wires completely, continue connecting alligator wires as described for other PL cables.

### Step 26

#### Description

Inside your PL cable, are color coated inner wires - colors may vary.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/step26.jpg)

### Step 27

#### Description

Use the cutters to strip the edges of the three inner wires and twist together 2 of the wires coming out of the PL cable. The color of the wires is insignificant at this point. 

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/step27.jpg)

### Step 28

#### Description

Connect an alligator wire to the twisted wires.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/step28.jpg)


#### Important

If you don't have alligator wires, wrap the exposed magnetic wire around both ends of the inner wires. Secure with tape.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/Extra/step28/extra.jpg)


### Step 29

#### Description

Connect the other end of the alligator wire to a wire coming out of the membrane.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/step29.jpg)

#### Important

To ensure the connection, wrap the wire around the alligator's clips.

### Step 30

#### Description

Connect the second alligator wire to the free inner wire.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/step30.jpg)

### Step 31

#### Description

Connect the other end of the alligator wire to the second wire coming out of the membrane.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/step31.jpg)


### Step 32

#### Description

Connect the PL cable to your phone or iPad and play music. Increase the volume to the maximum.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/step28.jpg)



### Step 33

#### Description

Hold the speaker up, against you ear. Make sure the magnet is facing out â€“ away from your ear.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson3-Earphone/assets/step33.jpg)


#### Important

The music player transmits constantly changing electrical signals through the PL cable to the magnet wire, temporarily turning it into an electromagnet. The electromagnet vibrates back and forth, attracted and repelled rapidly from the permanent magnet. Since the wire is glued to the masking tape, this causes the tape to move back and forth as well, generating air waves which are translated with our ears (and by our brain) into sound.



### Step 34

#### Description

Changing the distance between the magnet and the membrane controls the bass levels.
