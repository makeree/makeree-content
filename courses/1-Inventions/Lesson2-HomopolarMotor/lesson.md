## About

### Description
The homopolar motor is a simple electrical machine that converts electrical signals into motion. In fact, it was the first electric motor ever built. This is a unique motor since the circular motion that is produced, is a result of the combination between electric and magnetic fields.

### Step 2

#### Description 

 Use cutters and fully strip the wire from the isolating coating.

#### Important

A few stripping techniques will be introduced. Choose the one you find most convenient. Begin with holding the cutters in parallel to the wire.

#### Important 	

Cut the coating in parallel to the direction of the wire, avoid cutting the conductive wire itself.

#### Important

Repeat this process until the wire is fully exposed.

### Step 3

#### Description

The conductive wire should be fully exposed.

### Step 4

#### Description

Use needle-nose pliers, avoid mistakenly using cutters. Bend the wire at the center. Try to be as accurate as possible and fold the wire in two.

### Step 5

#### Description

Bend the wire, forming a V shape.

#### Important

Using the needle-nose pliers allows squeezing the wire tighter together.

### Step 6

#### Description

Grip the wire with the needle-nose pliers about 0.25'' (5 mm) from the vertex you have just created and bend the wire outwards.

### Step 7

#### Description

Repeat on the other side of the wire.

### Step 8

#### Description

"Bend the wire again, 1'' (3 cm) from the previous bending point. Twist the wire 90 degrees inwards.

### Step 9

#### Description

Repeat on the other side of the wire.

### Step 10

#### Description

"Take an AA battery and 3 round rare-earth magnets.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson2-HomopolarMotor/assets/step10.jpg)

#### Important

Rare-earth magnets are the strongest type of magnets, made out of alloys of rare earth elements. They produce significantly stronger magnetic fields in comparison to other types of magnets.




### Step 11

#### Description

Place the magnets on the battery's negative terminal.

### Step 12

#### Description

Balance the tip of the wire on the battery's positive terminal.

### Step 13

#### Description

Identify the point on the wire that is the same height as the second magnet.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson2-HomopolarMotor/assets/step13.jpg)

#### Important

Identify this point by drawing an imaginary line from the middle magnet at the end of the battery, leading to the wire.

#### Important

As a result of the current running through the circuit, the battery might warm up and runtime may shorten



### Step 24

#### Description

And watch it spin.

> ![]([BASE]/courses/1-Inventions/Lesson2-HomopolarMotor/assets/step24.jpg)

#### Important

This motor generates motion with the use of electrically charged particles in a magnetic field. Current flows through the wire, meaning electrons are moving in a certain direction along the wire. Since the wire is placed in a magnetic field, the electrons are affected by a force vigorously moving them in a different direction and therefore creating the accelerating movement of the coil. This basic law of physics is called the Lorentz force. Although the motion generating principles at the base of the Homopolar Motor are simple, it is are rarely used nowadays as it is an inefficient motor- requiring large current flow and producing relatively small forces.

#### Description

Add your personal touch by decorating the wire.
