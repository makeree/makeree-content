## About

### Description
A Hydraulic arm is a moving arm that uses liquid fluid power to control movement. Syringes positioned at the Hydraulic arm's joints, conveying water through tubes, push and pull the arm's components and allow playfully exploring the liquid's role as a source of mechanical force.

#### Important

If you cannot use a hole puncher, substitute by using a craft knife. Create holes with a knife by drilling it into the wooden surface with a rotating motion.

#### Important

This motor generates motion with the use of electrically charged particles in a magnetic field. Current flows through the wire, meaning electrons are moving in a certain direction along the wire. Since the wire is placed in a magnetic field, the electrons are affected by a force vigorously moving them in a different direction and therefore creating the accelerating movement of the coil. This basic law of physics is called the Lorentz force. Although the motion generating principles at the base of the Homopolar Motor are simple, it is are rarely used nowadays as it is an inefficient motor- requiring large current flow and producing relatively small forces.
